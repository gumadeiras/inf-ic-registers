Trying `homotopy = gmin' for initial conditions.
Trying `homotopy = source' for initial conditions.

Notice from spectre during IC analysis, during transient analysis `transient1', during task `MDLControl'.
    GminDC = 1 pS is large enough to noticeably affect the DC solution.
        dV(xB2.MP2.mpfet:int_di) = 14.0962 mV
        Use the `gmin_check' option to eliminate or expand this report.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.
