Trying `homotopy = gmin' for initial conditions.

Notice from spectre during IC analysis, during transient analysis `transient1', during task `MDLControl'.
    GminDC = 1 pS is large enough to noticeably affect the DC solution.
        dV(xFA0.xNand0.MM3.mnfet:int_di) = -3.09401 mV
        Use the `gmin_check' option to eliminate or expand this report.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.
