Notice from spectre during IC analysis, during transient analysis `timeSweep'.
    GminDC = 1 pS is large enough to noticeably affect the DC solution.
        dV(xNandInvReg.XNAND4.Mn1.mnfet:int_di) = -5.56595 mV
        Use the `gmin_check' option to eliminate or expand this report.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.
